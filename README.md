## Moonstruck

Moonstruck is a minimalist, design-focused website I designed and built for an ongoing concert series. It has been used by 300+ concert-goers.

### The website
Concert-goers can RSVP on the website and will receive an automated email containing a map to our next concert's secret location. I researched and experimented with a number of email integrations before landing on an external, newly developed JavaScript email API which enables the site to stay entirely browser-based and lightweight.

The entirety of the frontend design was built with JavaScript, HTML5, and SASS-compiled CSS3. The artwork featured on the site was custom-made for the concert series. Using CSS3 animations, I gave the hand-drawn moon a rotation effect, implemented a moving gradient that shadows the concert date, and gave a wiggle effect to the RSVP button. The design is fully responsive and device-agnostic.

### The concert
Moonstruck is a wild concert series, taking place every full moon. We present music, poetry, and art in the urban wilderness of the East Bay. All of our concerts explore what it means to call this place home. If you like music and find yourself in the Bay Area, please RSVP for our next show!

This project was designed and built in one week.
